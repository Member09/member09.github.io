# 🙏 Hello, I'm Nidhi

I'm a machine learning enthusiast focused on **NLP, LLMs, and AGI research**.  
This portfolio showcases my deep learning projects and reproducible research. My work revolves around:

- 🔬 Exploring and reproducing **scaling laws** in deep learning
- 🧠 Building transformer architectures from scratch
- ⚙️ Fine-tuning LLMs for domain-specific applications
- 📈 Conducting empirical research to understand model behaviors
